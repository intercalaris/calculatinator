https://calculatinator.netlify.app/ (demo)

A fun calculator project, complete with an aesthetic interactive interface that works on both mobile and computer screens and all the necessary logic to handle typical calculator use (such as entering a number, then an operator, then a number, and then another operator, which results in a calculation being performed while allowing the input of yet another number).
